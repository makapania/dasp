## Interpretation

### Acceptance Criteria

- **R² match:** Within ±2% for deterministic models (PLS, Ridge, Lasso)
- **R² match:** Within ±5% for stochastic models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Correlation:** >0.99 for identical implementations
- **Statistical significance:** p > 0.05 indicates no systematic difference

### Conclusions

**Bone Collagen:**
- [WARN] R² difference (2.89%) is within ±5% but exceeds ±2%
- [FAIL] Correlation (0.9460) indicates poor agreement
- [WARN] Significant difference detected (p=0.0375 < 0.05)

**Enamel d13C:**
- [FAIL] R² difference (10.86%) exceeds ±5% threshold
- [FAIL] Correlation (0.9345) indicates poor agreement
- [WARN] Significant difference detected (p=0.0023 < 0.05)
